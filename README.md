This Readme is writen to the project examiner why i have submitted something not even half-finished, more like half-started.

This Will be a Quiz app sometime in the future. for now it will be a failed project submission, i have had a really har time getting to grips with the DOM tree.
most of this project so far is made with the help of a youtube tutorial and was not ment for subbmision, just an attempt to get my head around it by doing. 

I know that this will fail and fail badly. 
I have just requested a course tempo slowdown with Digital Lyftet to help me get more of a chance in the future projects!
